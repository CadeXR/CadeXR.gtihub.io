          <p className="mb-4">
            FlexVR Wellness is an ecosystem developed to facilitate electro-stimulation therapy over XR environments, 
            aiming to reduce patient stress. The system allows therapists to use AR headsets to communicate with and 
            remotely control therapy sessions in calming VR environments.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This system was created in 60 hours at MIT Reality Hack and won the award "Hardware: Creative Inputs/Outputs." 
            It was created by Cade Gilbert, Shane Mckelvey, James Higdon, Peter He, Ty Lindell, and mentored by Rina Kim.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Understanding The Problem</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            When we started working on this project, we had a question we wanted to answer: How can we make a patient's 
            experience, in any field, more comfortable, without making the professional's job harder? We understood that 
            VR scenes could be used to visually stimulate patients in a calmer environment while a professional was at 
            work and decided to build on that idea.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            For our demo, we used a programmable device called a StimDuino, an open-source Arduino-based board to allow 
            us to fine control electrodes using code, as well as integrating it with a suite of XR devices using OSC 
            and Unity.

            <p className="mb-4">
              A scene built in Unity 2022 with distracting colors and visuals, allowing for the patient to be immersed 
              and not focused on the fear that can come from electro-stimulation therapy.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">E-Stim Device</h3>
            <p>
              A small form factor device that can be clipped onto the belt or pants of the patient, with two electrodes 
              running to set positions on the user's arm.
