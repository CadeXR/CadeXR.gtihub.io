          Professionally, I work as a UX Design contractor at Sinn Studio, known for the PSVR best-seller <i>Swordsman VR</i>. I'm currently designing features and content for their upcoming PvP sandbox game, <i>Battlegrounds</i>. My responsibilities include prototyping, gameplay design, map creation, and community management. I also lead Golden Gear Studios, an indie game studio I founded, where I direct and manage <i>Hex VR</i>, a zero-gravity sports game that's seen over 50,000 downloads in its alpha demo.

          My creative toolkit spans Unity, Unreal, Blender, and DaVinci Resolve—tools I've used both professionally and as a long-time hobbyist. I'm also an award-winning project manager at MIT Reality Hack, where I led the FlexVR-Wellness project to recognition in the "Creative Hardware Inputs and Outputs" track. Now an event organizer, I continue to contribute to the XR space with a mix of technical expertise, creative vision, and a deep commitment to the growth of the industry.
